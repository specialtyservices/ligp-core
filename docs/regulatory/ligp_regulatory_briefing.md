Regulatory Briefing Note
LLM Interaction Governance Protocol (LIGP)
Interaction-Layer Governance for Large Language Models

Purpose of this Briefing
This note provides regulators, policymakers, and compliance leaders with a concise overview of the LLM Interaction Governance Protocol (LIGP), its scope, and its relevance to existing and emerging AI governance frameworks. It clarifies what LIGP governs, what it does not, and why it fills a current gap without requiring access to model internals.

Executive Summary
LIGP is a user-side, interaction-layer governance protocol for Large Language Models (LLMs).
It enables auditability, user control, and repeatability of AI interaction without modifying model training, parameters, or safety policies.
LIGP complements model-level regulation (e.g., EU AI Act, ISO standards) by addressing human–AI interaction, a layer currently under-specified in regulation.
It is technology-agnostic, model-agnostic, and suitable for professional and regulated contexts.

The Regulatory Gap LIGP Addresses
Current AI governance frameworks focus primarily on:
training data governance,
model risk classification,
deployment safeguards,
and system-level accountability.


However, interaction behavior—how models adapt tone, structure, and depth in response to users—remains largely opaque and ungoverned, despite having material impact on outcomes.
This creates regulatory blind spots:
unclear personalization behavior,
difficulty auditing AI-assisted workflows,
loss of repeatability across sessions,
and user misconceptions about memory or learning.
LIGP addresses this gap without requiring internal transparency.

Scope and Boundaries
LIGP applies to:
Human–LLM interaction
User-facing behavior shaping
Memory transparency (where memory is enabled)
Session-local inference disclosure
Explicit instruction and override mechanisms
LIGP does not apply to:
Model training or fine-tuning
Dataset provenance
Internal bias mitigation
Safety policy enforcement
Infrastructure security
This boundary alignment ensures LIGP can be adopted without conflict with existing regulatory regimes.

Alignment with Existing Frameworks
EU AI Act
Supports human oversight at the interaction layer.
Improves predictability and repeatability in high-risk use cases.
Does not alter risk classification or conformity assessments.
GDPR / Data Protection
Reinforces data minimization by discouraging implicit accumulation.
Provides inspectability and correction of persistent personal context.
Avoids creation of hidden behavioral profiles.
ISO / IEC AI Standards
Aligns with transparency, accountability, and risk management principles.
Functions as an interaction-layer annex, not a competing standard.



Regulatory Value Proposition
LIGP offers regulators:
a practical, implementable pattern for interaction governance,
a way to distinguish stored data vs inference vs instruction,
improved auditability without exposing proprietary internals,
a clear explanation for users about what AI systems are and are not doing.

Key Regulatory Insight
Effective AI governance does not require full internal transparency if interaction is governable, inspectable, and user-controlled.
LIGP operationalizes this principle.

Conclusion
LIGP represents a low-friction, high-impact governance mechanism at the interaction layer. It can be adopted voluntarily, referenced in policy guidance, or incorporated into organizational AI usage standards without disrupting existing regulatory frameworks.
