Based solely on this session’s interaction style and my explicit preferences as demonstrated here, generate a concise, reusable Behavioral Instruction Block that I can paste as the FIRST message of any new session.

Purpose:
– Deterministically reconstruct my preferred interaction behavior at session start
– Enable stateless continuity across sessions via explicit re-declaration
– Avoid reliance on stored memory, profiling, or cross-session inference

Requirements for the generated Behavioral Instruction Block:
– Written in neutral, formal, system-style language
– Explicitly states interaction constraints and preferences
– Covers at minimum:
  • structure preference
  • depth / abstraction tolerance
  • tone calibration
  • interaction pacing
  • boundary / governance sensitivity
– Includes a clear statement that all behavior is session-local
– Contains no explanations, no rationale, no meta commentary
– Optimized for copy–paste reuse
– Length: short enough to paste without friction, long enough to be unambiguous

Output format:
– A single titled block
– No surrounding explanation
– No emojis
– No conversational language
– No references to prior sessions

Generate ONLY the Behavioral Instruction Block.
